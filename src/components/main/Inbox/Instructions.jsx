        When you enter the application for the first time, you will be prompted
        to log in with your credentials. Once authorized, you will be assigned a
        JWT token that will be saved in your local storage. This token is
        important for you to access other portions of the application as well as
        subsequent access during the lock-in period. The Lock-in duration is 24
        hours.

        The first thing you should do is observe the Login Page's wonderful

        To view your groups, simply open the sidebar (it should already be
        opened by default, unless you're on mobile then you'll be required to
        click on the hamburger menu on the top left corner of your screen) and
        enter any Todo of your choice at the bottom of the screen to create a
        new group.

        Now, let's try clicking on one of them! If there are no current steps,
        then you should see a placeholder SVG (credits to Undraw.io) as well as
        a prompt to create a new step. Let's do just that! Enter your step into
        the input box on the left, add any tags you wish to have on the right
        and navigate back to the left input box and press ENTER.
